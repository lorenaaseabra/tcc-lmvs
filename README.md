# Beyond Code: Understanding How Traditional Productivity Metrics Overlook Women in Software Engineering

## üìò Overview

This repository contains the research project and supporting materials for the study titled:

**"Beyond Code: Understanding How Traditional Productivity Metrics Overlook Women in Software Engineering"**

The research investigates how traditional productivity metrics in software engineering fail to reflect the lived experiences and contributions of women in the field.

## üß† Abstract

Software engineering productivity is commonly evaluated through quantitative metrics such as lines of code, number of commits, and task completion time. However, these traditional indicators often fail to account for the social, cultural, and physiological factors that influence women‚Äôs contributions in the workplace.

This study adopts a mixed-methods approach to investigate how female software engineers experience and perceive productivity within the industry. Data were collected in two phases:
- A **national survey** with 85 women in software engineering roles across Brazil.
- **In-depth interviews** with 20 participants, including developers, technical leads, and engineering managers.

The survey explored topics such as demographic background, workplace conditions, productivity expectations, evaluation practices, and experiences with inclusion and bias. The interviews enabled deeper investigation into how organizational culture, microaggressions, gender norms, and dual workloads affect performance and recognition.

Findings indicate that productivity perceptions are deeply shaped by non-technical elements, including emotional labor, collaboration efforts, and workplace dynamics‚Äîfactors not captured by conventional metrics. Many women reported lower self-perception of productivity despite delivering equivalent results, largely due to lack of recognition and implicit bias.

This study contributes to the emerging discourse on inclusive metrics in software engineering by highlighting how existing models overlook gendered experiences. Although no new metrics are proposed here, the analysis lays the groundwork for future research toward fairer evaluation systems and greater equity in the field.
